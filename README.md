# eShop
Only search endpoints are implemented, with limited data scope.
Privided the time, much more things can be done.

Assumptions made ::::::

1. valid brands - levis,wrangler,spyker,mufti,roadster
2. valid sku - 100001-100030
3. valid price - 13, 123 (only fixed price is implemented, ideally it should be the range and can be implemented)
4. valid size - S,M,L
5. valid color - white,red,black
6. valid seller ids - 1,2,3


Database schema is checked in along with the code in git.
